            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat.</li>
                <li>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides. </li>
                <li>Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat. </li>
                <li>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet </li>
                <li>Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened.
                    Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more. </li>
                <li>Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot. </li>
                <li>Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste. </li>
                <li>Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste.</li>
                <li>Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty. </li>
                <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. 
                    Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches. </li>
                <li>Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. 
                    Add the dry lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions.<br>                    
                <strong>Note:</strong>Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking.
                </li>
                <li> When ready, drain in a colander and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.</li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 375F</li>
                <li>Assemble the lasagna</li>
                <li>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminium foil, and bake at 375F for 45 minutes</li>
                <li>Bon Appetit!!!</li>
